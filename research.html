								<p>Eames received his Bachelor of Arts from Bard College in 2014, graduating with a major in Physics. He attended Texas A&amp;M University for graduate school, receiving his Masters of Science in 2016 and his Doctor of Philosophy in 2020, both in physics. Eames then worked as a postoral researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory until 2023 when he was converted to an R&amp;D Scientist at the laboratory. Currently, Eames is a student in the ninth cycle of the Theoretical Institute for Thermonuclear and Nuclear Studies (TITANS) and a staff member in X-Theoretical Design Division's Integrated Device Assessment (XTD-IDA) group.</p>

											<p>During his time at Bard College, Eames spent most of his time working at the newly-founded Bard NanoLab directed by <a href="https://www.bard.edu/faculty/paul-cadden-zimansky">Dr. Paul Cadden-Zimansky</a>. Here he worked primarily on fabrication techniques for monolayer and bilayer graphene samples, building annealing chambers, vacuum systems, and plasma deposition devices. In addition to this, Eames attended a Research Experience for Undergraduates in 2013 at Texas A&amp;M University at the Texas A&amp;M Cyclotron Institute where he worked with <a href="https://artsci.tamu.edu/physics-astronomy/contact/profiles/dan-melconian.html">Dr. Dan Melconian</a> on developing electrostatic optics for beam transport to a novel penning trap being developed for the TAMUTRAP facility. His senior project research culminated in the development of several monolayer and bilayer graphene samples, which were tested at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, Florida. In addition, Eames aided in the initial analysis of a bilayer graphene sample that exhibited energy structures consistent with an effect known as the Hofstadter Butterfly. Preliminary results were published in his Senior Project, <a href="https://digitalcommons.bard.edu/senproj_s2014/133/">"The Hofstadter Butterly and IR Spectroscopy of High Mobility Graphene" (2014)</a>.</p>

											<p>As an undergraduate student, Eames took full advantage of the liberal arts college he attended by taking a variety of courses across the academic spectrum. While most of his coursework centered around physics, mathematics, and computer science, he also spent a significant amount of time studying jazz composition and performance.</p>

											<p>The research activities Eames undertook at Texas A&amp;M University can be broken roughly into three primary categories: his work for the Texas A&amp;M University Penning Trap (TAMUTRAP) facility, his work for the Transfer and Inelastic All-angle Reaction Array (TIARA), and his work analyzing data from the Detector Array for Neutron Capture Experiments (DANCE) at Los Alamos National Laboratory.</p>

										<dl>
											<dt>TAMUTRAP</dt>
											<dd>
												<p>Eames was instrumental in validating, designing, and aiding in fabrication of a prototype half-scale TAMUTRAP device. His work centered around refining initial work done by M. Mehlman characterizing the design of a novel cylindrical penning trap with a smaller length-to-radius ratio than traditional penning traps. Most of Eames' work centered on validating calculations, making numerical estimates of transport efficiency using SIMION, aiding with further development of a low-voltage ion transport system and the associated beamline components, characterizing a seven Tesla superconducting magnet, as well as modeling and designing components of the apparatus with CAD.</p>
											</dd>
											<dt>TIARA</dt>
											<dd>
												<p>After finishing his work on TAMUTRAP, Eames worked under <a href="https://www.ap.smu.ca/~gchristian/cv.html">Dr. Greg Christian</a> to stand up a new detector array at the Texas A&amp;M Cyclotron Institute. TIARA for Texas (T4T) integrated Transfer and Inelastic All-angle Reaction Array (TIARA) with the Multipole-Dipole-Multipole-2 Spectrometer (MDM-2) to create a new capability for making direct measurements of astrophysically-relevant reactions. Eames leveraged his experience to play a central role in standing up the initial experimental capability and commissioning the detector array. After the commissioning campaign, Eames analyzed experimental data measuring the <sup>23</sup>Na(d,p)<sup>24</sup>Na reaction and published the results in his dissertation <a href="https://oaktrust.library.tamu.edu/items/9b28aa7d-907c-48cb-ad39-c8e5fed8a823">Indirect Studies of Astrophysical Radiative Capture Reactions (2020)</a>.</p>
											</dd>
											<dt>DANCE</dt>
											<dd>
												<p>As a final capstone to his graduate research, Eames spent over three months at Los Alamos National Laboratory working with <a href="https://laro.lanl.gov/esploro/profile/aaron_couture/overview">Dr. Aaron Couture</a> on data collected with the Detector for Advanced Neutron Capture Experiments (DANCE). His work on DANCE involved analyzing data from an experiment measuring the <sup>57</sup>Fe(n,g)<sup>58</sup>Fe reaction, with the goal of elucidating nuclear reactions crucial to measuring stellar processes. His analysis focused on analyzing the gamma strength function of <sup>58</sup>Fe and the results are published in his dissertation <a href="https://oaktrust.library.tamu.edu/items/9b28aa7d-907c-48cb-ad39-c8e5fed8a823">Indirect Studies of Astrophysical Radiative Capture Reactions (2020)</a>. His findings have helped in the in analyzing a complimentary measurement of the <sup>59</sup>Fe(d,p)<sup>60</sup>Fe reaction at the Texas A&amp;M Cyclotron Institute using the Detector Array for Photons, Protons, and Exotic Residues (DAPPER).</p>

										<dt>Physics Division</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>As a postdoctoral researcher in P-3, Eames was a key figure in advancing next-generation nuclear physics capabilities at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE), most notably in the design, deployment, and commissioning of the Correlated Gamma-Neutron Array for sCattering (CoGNAC). Working with <a href="https://laro.lanl.gov/esploro/profile/keegan_kelly/overview">Dr. Keegan Kelly</a>, Eames led the design and simulation of this next-generation dual n-gamma detector array. His key developments involved designing a novel low-mass, modular detector structure and a new target-changing system for scattering experiments that minimized the impact of secondary scattering effects on measurements performed with CoGNAC. His work also included helping to commission CoGNAC at the Weapons Neutron Research (WNR) facility as well as aiding in the analysis of data from the 2021 beam cycle, which focused on neutron scattering experiments on <sup>9</sup>Be, <sup>27</sup>Al, and <sup>56</sup>Fe. Additionally, Eames helped with GENESIS experiments performed between 2020 and 2022 at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE), overseeing operations and aiding with data analysis efforts including a measurement of the <sup>238</sup>U inelastic scattering cross section.</p>
										</dd>
										<dt>X-Theoretical Design Division</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>As a member of X-Theoretical Design Division, Eames has focused on applying nuclear physics to solve global and national security problems. His current work ranges from stockpile stewardship and nuclear forensics to aiding in the development of a Neutron Target Demonstrator (NTD) at LANSCE.</p>
